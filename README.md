Project files for the practical exercises of the Robotic Systems Control (30341EN) course at TU Cluj.

For each exercise, I will add relevant scripts to help you complete and visualise the excersises. The aim is to provide functions in Matlab and python, and other languages that might seem relevant in the future.

## Lab 1
Function for drawing the objects of the first assignment, in order to easily visualise the results of the rotations

### Food for thought

## Lab 2
Functions for calculating homogenius transformation matrices for various transformations and for drawing segments of a robot based on the geometric model described by multiple transformation matrices.

## Lab 3
Function to draw multiple segments of a robot and change the DH parameters for each of the segments
