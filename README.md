Project files for the practical exercises of the Robotic Systems Control (30341EN) course at TU Cluj.

For each exercise, I will add relevant scripts to help you complete and visualise the excersises. The aim is to provide functions in Matlab and python, and other languages that might seem relevant in the future.
